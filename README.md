#  UnderTrial Judicial System (Team Project - TechDesk Hackathon, Theme - Data Structures and Algorithm ) 

This project aims to revolutionize the way court cases are scheduled by applying various Data Structure Algorithms (DSA) and scheduling mechanisms.
The goal is to prioritize cases based on their urgency and importance, ensuring a more efficient and fair judicial process.

The system is designed to handle a large volume of cases, intelligently categorizing and scheduling them to optimize court resources.
By doing so, we hope to significantly reduce the backlog of cases and improve the overall efficiency of the judicial system.
 
 The Graphical User Interface (GUI) is now under development
